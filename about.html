            <h1>A bit about me...</h1>
            <p>I'm Caroline, a software engineer! Software engineering fascinates me because I think it's incredibly cool that I have the ability to make a product that could impact hundreds of people right at my fingertips. As someone who loves staying up to date with the current culture, I have always been intrigued by how technology and culture are intertwined. My goal is to work on products that positively drive the currents of culture and society.</p>
            <p>Currently, most of my time is spent studying as a junior at Brown University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. This summer, I'm excited to be a software engineering intern at Intelsat designing and developing new satellite terminal technology.</p>
            <p>I spend as much of my spare time as possible with my dog, Bella, when I'm at home in Maryland. You can also find me reading, crocheting, or listening to Taylor Swift 🪩.</p>
