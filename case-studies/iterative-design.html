        <p>For this project, I worked in a group on a redesign for Partiful, an event planning website. Specifically, Partiful asked us to reimagine the settings of their mobile app. Despite having helpful settings, Partiful noticed that users were not utilizing the settings to their full extent or were even aware of the existence of many of the settings. The end goal was to create a high-fidelity prototype in Figma of our redesigned Event Settings page that would enhance the user experience of navigating the settings. However, before we could reach this end goal, we had to go through iterations of sketchings, low fidelity wireframes, and critiques, detailed below.</p>
        <div class="proj-overview">
          <p><b>Role:</b> my role</p>
          <p><b>Skills:</b> my skills</p>
          <p><b>Tools:</b> my tools</p>
        </div>
        <span class="anchor" id="partiful-2"></span>
        <h2>Evaluating the Current Product</h2>
        <p>Partiful is a new event planning site aimed at younger generations. Thus, as college students we were already familiar with the product. However, many of us had not used the settings page! Additionally, Partiful asked us to specifically look at the mobile version, which was new to us. We spent an hour or two becoming familiar with the Event Planning page and connected Event Settings page. The problem statement Partiful gave to us was: “How might we make event settings more prominent and easier to navigate for hosts?” This was the underlying question we kept in mind throughout. The current Partiful app is shown below for reference.</p>
