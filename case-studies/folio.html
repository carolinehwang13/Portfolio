        <p>Nowadays, it is extremely common for people to have portfolios showcasing themselves and their work, espcially in computer science. As a rising senior, I felt that it was time that I had my own portfolio. Thus, I created the website that you are looking at right now! I wanted to make this so that I could utilize it during my job search after graduation as well as showcase projects I'm proud of. Even though it would be professional, I still wanted it to showcase my personality and what makes me unique, so I spent a lot of time thinking about the design, which I'm excited for you to explore below.</p>
        <span class="anchor" id="folio-2"></span>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Since there are thousands of portfolios out there, I wanted to take some time looking through them to decide what ideas I might want to incorporate into my own. From this experiences, I was able to recognize some practices I did and did not want to include, which are summarized in this table.</p>
        <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Do's</th>
          <th>Don'ts</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>An intriguing front page that captures the most important details about you (elevator pitch)</li>
              <li>Highlight your best skills and abilities, especially things you want to do professionally</li>
              <li>Maintain a clear narrative</li>
              <li>Balance showing (images) and telling (text)</li>
              <li>Highlight results/impacts of your projects</li>
              <li>Share personality</li>
              <li>Make the site responsive</li>
              <li>Make it clear what youâ€™re interested in and what you care about</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>Bog pages down with too much detail and text</li>
              <li>Have an overwhelming amount of projects</li>
              <li>Be pretentious</li>
              <li>Assume the reader knows the context</li>
              <li>Let design distract from the content</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p>With these ideas in mind, it was time for me to think about what I wanted my portfolio to look like. From the portfolios I looked at, I knew that I needed an impactful front page that introduced the most important parts of me professionally while also getting across my personality.</p>
        <p>I knew I wanted to do a simple yet colorful background. In many of the portfolios that stood out to me, there was some kind of playful animation on the front page, so I thought about ways to incorporate that. I decided on the theme of a butterfly garden. With this theme, I could include color, a playful animated butterfly, and my love for the outdoors. Additionally, I loved the symbolism of the butterfly: the metamorphasis of myself and my work over time.</p>
        <span class="anchor" id="folio-3"></span>
        <h2>Sketching and Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h2>
        <h3>Sketching</h3>
        <p>Even though I knew I wanted to incorporate a butterfly into the front page, I wasn't exactly sure what that would look like. So, that meant I needed to draw some sketches! I only sketched the front page because I knew I would keep the other pages relatively simple to not distract from the content.</p>
        <div class="image-group">
          <img class="norbys-image" src="../assets/folio/sketch1.jpg" alt="Front page sketch">
          <img class="norbys-image" src="../assets/folio/sketch2.jpg" alt="Front page sketch">
          <img class="norbys-image" src="../assets/folio/sketch3.jpg" alt="Front page sketch">
          <p class="caption">Front page sketches</p>
        </div>
        <p>Looking at these sketches side by side, I decided I wanted to follow the vision of the third sketch (bottom center). This design felt simple and clean but also playful without being too overcrowded.</p>
        <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
        <p>Since I only sketched the front page, I still wanted to have an idea of what the rest of the pages would look like to make it easier when I started coding. I made a quick low-fidelty wireframe and style guide of what I envisioned. This took longer than I expected because I wanted to make sure that the colors and font would create the aesthetic I wanted. Again, these were pretty simple so as not to distract from the content. Much of the features I included were inspired by the portfolios I had looked through earlier, like the table of contents on the projects pages and the general idea of what contents to include.</p>
        <div class="image-group">
          <img class="folio-img" src="../assets/folio/style.png" alt="Style guide">
          <img class="folio-img" src="../assets/folio/lofi1.png" alt="Low-fidelity front page">
          <img class="folio-img" src="../assets/folio/lofi2.png" alt="Low-fidelity projects page">
          <img class="folio-img" src="../assets/folio/lofi3.png" alt="Low-fidelity project page">
          <img class="folio-img" src="../assets/folio/lofi4.png" alt="Low-fidelity about page">
          <p class="caption">Style guide and wireframes</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>I had the opportunity to receive feedback on my low-fidelty designs from some of my peers. They each were supportive of the butterfly motif and color palette, which was great to hear. They also liked the layout of the case study page (this page!). Some suggestions they had were that I consider removing the "fun" page because I wasn't sure what to put it in. They also recommended bolding important words on the case study pages and being sure to label images or make clear what they are.</p>
        <span class="anchor" id="folio-4"></span>
        <h2>Making the Website</h2>
        <p>When it was time to make the website, I felt pretty confident because I already knew what I wanted it to look it. Because of deadlines, I decided to start off with the front page having only a simple background and no butterflies. This is because I knew drawing the butterflies would take a lot of time and wanted to make sure I had enough time to finish the actual content of the pages. Unfortunately, I was unable to get to adding the butterflies because of the time constraints, but I definitely will keep updating this portfolio and add them when I can.</p>
        <p>Coding the whole thing was not so much difficult as it was time consuming, simply because there are a multiple pages and the case study pages are text heavy. A couple of challenges I ran into were getting the buttons to link to other pages and linking my resume as a pdf. However, these were solved by quick Google searches. Another challenge I faced was how to make the case study table of contents remain on the page while the text scrolled. In the end, I was able to get it to remain stationary by looking through suggestions online. Although, ideally, the table of contents would scroll with the text until the top of the page, then stay still. However, I was unable to get this to work and would like to keep working on this.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overall, I was very satisfied with how this portfolio turned out! It was great to reflect on my past work while thinking about what I want to carry with me into the future from this work. This project forced me to think about how I wanted to present myself and my ideals. Even though it was very time consuming to make, I know that I will be glad to have this portfolio to show others, and it is a reflection of myself that I am proud of. Additionally, I am excited to keep adding to this portfolio as I make new projects and share them with others. I hope you have enjoyed this portfolio as much as I have!</p>
